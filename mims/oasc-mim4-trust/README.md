## Objectives <a href="#mim1-contextinformationmanagement-goal" id="mim1-contextinformationmanagement-goal"></a>

Citizen data is a key element in providing human-centric public services. MIM4 Personal Data Management (PDM) explores the mechanisms for personal data protection, transparency, and trust when sharing personal data between cities. These capabilities are a key part of the digital transformation journey of cities worldwide.&#x20;

MIM4 PDM, consists of four layers, Personal Data Operator, personal data platforms, legal framework and technical specification.&#x20;

MIM4 PDM supports citizens' rights to:

* Have insight what personal data is available, stored, shared, etc. by the providers of the applications and/or services in use;
* Change and/or delete part or all personal data available, stored, shared, etc. by the provider of the applications and/or services in use;
* Indicate in which circumstances what personal data is ‚Äòfree‚Äô to use for which parties through a 'permission arrangement‚Äô;
* Grant consent to providers of the applications and/or services, be it governmental or businesses, that attribute based, decentralised storage and ‚Äòrevealing‚Äô of personal data attributes provides full service and access to these applications and/or services;
* Choose which operator stores personal data and be able to move from operator to operator.

## Capabilities

Personal Data Management needs to have an open API in line with MIM1 to broker data and standard data models MIM2.&#x20;

The PDM needs to be fully compatible with the GDPR and needs to enable users to handle consent, allow and revoke access, and have full transparency on their personal data. Permission management of consent management needs to be handled preferably on attribute level.

The PDM needs to allow users to choose the operator of their data and have a completely free choice to move their data to the operator of their choosing.\
It should allow the users to access their data regardless of the channel. So, there should be no wrong door to access the data.

We want to move the management of personal data to the following manner, where decentralised management of data is enabled.

The personal data is stored in so called data pods the way users will have access to their pods is depicted below. .

Citizens should be able to use the identity of their choosing, in best cases a keychain of identities can be defined, so that users can choose the identity per service.

Cities and regions are perfect candidates to provide personalised data services or to provide personal data to certified services.

Citizens should be able to roam with their data between cities and internationally.

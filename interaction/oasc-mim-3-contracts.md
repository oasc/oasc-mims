## Objectives <a href="mim3-ecosystemtransactionmanagement-goals" id="mim3-ecosystemtransactionmanagement-goals"></a>

Scaling of IoT- and AI-enabled services across many cities requires easy and risk-free access to suitable urban data sources that are already deployed in cities and communities today. A global market allows for easy and risk-free access to relevant and available urban data, solutions and other resources so that services and solutions already deployed in other cities can easily be scaled and reach mainstream deployment. The use and re-use lead to new revenue streams incentivising the infrastructure owners to share data, analytics, services and/or solutions in infrastructure partnerships based on key technology enablers.

With a set of marketplaces established all parties can co-create applications, solutions, services and guidelines on top of the common data models and standardised APIs. Facilitating this ecosystem of providers and consumers leads to sustainable business models and fair mechanisms for sharing and compensating, and it reduces the risk for investments.

## Capabilities <a href="mim3-ecosystemtransactionmanagement-capabilities" id="mim3-ecosystemtransactionmanagement-capabilities"></a>

The marketplace realises standardised exposure of data and data sets guaranteeing security and privacy by design. The marketplace also realises access to services that build on this data and transfer it to knowledge, intelligence and information for the consumers.

The marketplace provides catalogue management, ordering management, revenue (sharing) management, SLA management, quality management and data license management.

A crucial aspect of a marketplace is ecosystem transaction management. These functionalities enable effective matchmaking of urban IoT data sources from providers with respective data consumers, facilitate trusted exploitation of such data based on enforceable data usage agreements and secure value flow between these stakeholders.

There are various ways in realising such Ecosystem Transaction Management. A standardised way of doing so is provided by TM Forum, who has created an API suite of specifications for digital marketplaces, named the Business API Ecosystem.

## Specifications <a href="mim3-ecosystemtransactionmanagement-recommendedspecifications" id="mim3-ecosystemtransactionmanagement-recommendedspecifications"></a>

**Recommended specifications:**

* UDX (Urban Data Exchange) Catalogue: \[COMING SOON]
* Basic Data Marketplace Enablers [https://synchronicity-iot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SynchroniCity_D2.4.pdf](https://synchronicity-iot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SynchroniCity_D2.4.pdf)
* Guidelines for the integration of IoT devices in OASC compliant platforms  [https://synchronicity-iot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SynchroniCity_D2.6.pdf](https://synchronicity-iot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SynchroniCity_D2.6.pdf)
* TM Forum Open APIs and component suites provide service and a technology-neutral suite of APIs that provide the minimum building blocks for interoperability across all operational management areas.  Each API and component suite provide the specification, reference implementations and in most cases conformance test kits. Reference Implementations are available under the Apache2.0 license. These APIs have gained global adoption in the Telecommunications industry and are proven to maximize reuse. They are designed to be extendable as required for specific services. The respective data models have been harmonised with FIWARE and GSMA data models.
